# Github Latest

The goal for this activity is to:
  * Receive a GitHub username from the command line.
  * Retrieve a list of "events" associated with that user. User events include things like pushing to a repository or opening up an issue on a repository.
  * Print out the time stamp associated with the first event in that list.
  
The GitHub API documentation is [here](https://docs.github.com/en/rest). Note that the root of the API is [https://api.github.com/](https://api.github.com/), so when the documentation lists an endpoint like /feeds, that means that you can visit that endpoint at [https://api.github.com/feeds](https://api.github.com/feeds).
